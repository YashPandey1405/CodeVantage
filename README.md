# 🧠 CodeVantage – LeetCode-Inspired Full Stack Coding Platform

**CodeVantage** is my dream project — a full-stack LeetCode-like platform built from scratch to deeply understand scalable system architecture, real-time code execution, and production-ready deployment.

This platform is designed to allow users to solve coding problems, submit code in multiple languages, and get instant feedback — just like LeetCode, but fully customized and developer-built.

## 🛠️ Project Status

> 🔧 **Currently working on:** Backend (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL + Prisma)  
> 🎯 **Next planned phases:** React Frontend → AWS Deployment

---

## 🌟 Tech Stack Overview

### 🔩 Backend Stack

- **Node.js + Express**: Handles core server logic and REST API endpoints.
- **PostgreSQL + Prisma**: A powerful relational database paired with a type-safe ORM — perfect for user accounts, problem sets, and submission tracking.
- **Judge0 API**: Executes code in real-time across multiple languages. This will be the most complex and exciting part of the backend.

---

### 🎨 Frontend Stack

- **React + Vite**: Lightning-fast frontend with modern development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI**: Utility-first styling combined with sleek UI components.
- **Zustand**: Lightweight, intuitive state management (a Redux alternative).
- **Zod + React Hook Form**: Type-safe and scalable form validation.

---

## 🔄 Future Plans (Post v1 Launch)

Once the MVP is complete and deployed:

- 🧵 **Queue System Implementation** (RabbitMQ / BullMQ for managing Judge0 code execution tasks)
- 📡 **WebSocket Support** (for real-time judging updates and collaboration)

> ⚠️ These advanced features are planned for 2–3 months after the stable release of CodeVantage.

## 📌 Why This Project?

This is more than just a project — it's a **personal milestone**.  
CodeVantage is being built to sharpen my full-stack development skills, dive into systems design, and create something that can genuinely help others practice and grow in coding.
