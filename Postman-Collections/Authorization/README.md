# üñ•Ô∏è CodeVantage - Authorization Routes

This document explains the four core authorization routes of the **CodeVantage** full-stack project, focusing on **Signup**, **Login**, **Logout**, and **Check** functionalities.

These routes are crucial for handling user authentication and authorization.
